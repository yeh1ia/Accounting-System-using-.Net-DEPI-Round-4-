# .NET Accounting System

---

## Project Idea

A full-featured web-based accounting system built with ASP.NET Core, designed to help businesses manage their financial operations efficiently. The system handles the complete accounting cycle — from journal entries and general ledger to invoicing, bank reconciliation, tax management, budgeting, and multi-currency support. It is built on a clean layered architecture (Presentation → API → Business Logic → Data Access → Database) and includes a dedicated .NET Reporting Library that generates professional PDF reports and CSV exports using QuestPDF and CsvHelper, eliminating the need for any third-party reporting platforms.

## Project Plan

1. Research & Analysis
   - Audience personas: Small-to-medium business owners, accountants, finance managers, and auditors who need a centralized system to track financial transactions, generate reports, and ensure compliance

2. Visual Identity
   - Logo design: A clean, professional logo using navy blue and green tones to reflect trust and financial growth, incorporating a ledger or chart symbol

3. Main Designs
   - Poster: A system architecture poster showcasing the five-layer structure, key modules (GL, AP, AR, Inventory, Reporting), and the technology stack used

4. Complementary Products
   - .NET Reporting Library (PDF & CSV) — standalone library built with QuestPDF and CsvHelper, reusable across projects
   - REST API documentation via Swagger for third-party integrations
   - Admin dashboard for real-time financial monitoring

5. Review & Finalization
   - Full code review across all layers
   - Security audit: JWT validation, role-based access, and data encryption checks
   - Performance testing: load testing API endpoints and report generation
   - User acceptance testing (UAT) with sample accounting scenarios

6. Final Presentation
   - Live demo of the web application covering the full accounting workflow
   - Architecture walkthrough with the layered diagram
   - Reporting Library demo: generating a PDF balance sheet and CSV transaction export
   - Q&A session with the instructor and evaluators
